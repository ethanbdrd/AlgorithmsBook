# AlgorithmsBook

## Description
AlgorithmsBook is a collection of well-known algorithms implemented in Python. This project aims to provide clear, efficient, and well-documented implementations, all written from scratch. The repository will be continuously updated and improved over time.

## Features
- Implementations of the most famous algorithms
- Clean and well-structured Python code
- Continuous updates and improvements

## Installation
To clone the repository, use the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethanbdrd/AlgorithmsBook.git
```

## Usage
This repository consists of three main files:
- **userChoice.py**: Contains functions for user input selection, such as choosing the number of random integers they want to generate.
- **algos.py**: Implements various well-known algorithms.
- **main.py**: Manages the execution of algorithms and provides a user interface.

Simply navigate through the repository and explore the different algorithm implementations. Each algorithm will include:
- A Python script with the implementation
- Explanations and comments within the code
